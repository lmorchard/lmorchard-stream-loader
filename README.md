# lmorchard-stream-loader

This is a "starting soon" / "be right back" scene that I'm playing
with for [my live coding stream](https://twitch.tv/lmorchard). It's
inspired by old C64 loaders that would update the screen border with
data while decompressing content as it loaded.

Those old loaders were pretty flashy & seizuriffic, so I've tried to
make this version a bit more chill and smooth.
